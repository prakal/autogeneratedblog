{"name":"Pranav's personal blog","tagline":"Personal blog","body":"### Welcome to Pranav's coding blog!\r\nHi, I am Pranav, a beginner web developer based in Canada using primarily JavaScript and Python. I am trying to get to a professional level of web development, and developing my portfolio to reflect that. I am a big fan of immersive learning, and believe that I absorb more information when I am breathing code/algorithms. I am a chemical engineer as well, and have an analytical approach to problems, and eager to hunt for solutions.\r\n\r\nI have previously developed a web based platform for displaying, and recommending clothes on the Amazon store based on a person's measurements. For example, if you have a 32'' waist and 30'' long legs, *only* pants of those dimensions would be visible to you, rather than a generic S/M/L fit. I developed this project to sharpen my coding skills, and also to provide a service that I confirmed that people would use, by survey. Also, I saw potential for affiliate revenue. However, this did not work out, as I was using the Amazon Product Advertizing API (to be used only on blogs advertizing products) to populate my database, it was easy for them to reject API access before it got off the ground. Future reminder: Read through all terms and conditions before going out to build. I used Django(Python) and Javascript for this site.\r\n\r\n### What I am learning now\r\nI am learning [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com), a framework for Javascript, which makes dynamic web sites user friendly. After going through some tutorials, I will build a small app to showcase my efforts.\r\nI am also going to do tutorials for some TDD testing suites, as I don't have much familiarity with testing.\r\n\r\n### What I am looking for\r\nI am looking to join an organization that provides learning opportunities on the job. I wish to be working on new technologies, and designing efficient algorithms for general use cases.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Contact me\r\nYou can reach me at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/pranav-kalvapalle/25/984/1b7).
